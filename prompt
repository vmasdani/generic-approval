i need a python file in which i run something like this:

./manage.py run backend dev

it'll run things according to this json config

{
    "env": {
      "dev": {
        "db_host": "localhost",
        "db_name": "approval",
        "db_username": "root",
        "db_password": "mypass",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:8000"
      },
      "prod": {
        "db_host": "localhost",
        "db_name": "approval",
        "db_username": "root",
        "db_password": "mypass",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:8000"
      }
    }
  }
  
and it'll replace this string from the template file to the destination according to the env. for example
#{db_host}, becomes localhost
#{db_password}, becomes mypass

The files needed:
backend.env.template > ./backend/.env
admin.frontend.env.template > ./admin/.env
app.frontend.env.template > ./admin/.env

after that, run the actions with subprocess

The available actions are:

run:
- backend: php artisan serve in backend folder
- admin: yarn dev in admin folder
- app: yarn dev in app folder

build :
- backend: "zip -r release.zip ." in backend folder
- admin: yarn build, then "zip -r release.zip ." in dist folder. in admin folder
- app: yarn build, then "zip -r release.zip ." in dist folder. in app folder
